### Hi there 👋

I'm Archaeogeek, otherwise known as Jo Cook, or Jo Kaye if I'm going by my married name. I live in Lancaster in the North-West of the United Kingdom. When I'm not working I can be found either half way up a rock, or under the water. Generally not both at the same time.

- 🔭 I’m a Geospatial Data Architect at [Fathom](https://www.fathom.global/)
